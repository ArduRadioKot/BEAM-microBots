# BEAM-microbots
In this project I create microrobots with the ability to unite

# About progect
This project is dedicated to the creation of simple microrobots with the ability to combine into a single organism, imitating the behavior of simple organisms (for example, beetles). To load the project into the microcontroller, the UsbAsp program is required.
# How load code for Attiny13?
 To add Attini 13 support, launch the Arduino IDE and select File > Preferences. Copy the following URL into the Additional Board Manager URLs field: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sleemanj/optiboot/master/dists/package_gogo_diy_attiny_index.json.
# Hardware
The microrobot runs on attini13. The robot receives information from the environment using a photoresistor, moves using a vibration motor, and also sends signals using an SMD LED located next to the printed circuit board.
# How it work
